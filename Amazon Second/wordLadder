okay thanks for your explain, I guess i had a general idea about what the problem is doing, can i just restate the requirements about this problem to
make sure i understand each requirements correctly, and if you have some problems or any other advice for me, please just interrupt me and tell me thank you

1. input: start ="hit"，end = "cog"，dict =["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
output: shortest path 5 "hit"->"hot"->"dot"->"dog"->"cog" return 0 if
2.start and end may not in the dict
3.what if the length of start and end is not same?
4.do we have upper character in this dict?
5.do we have duplications in the dict?
6.do you make sure every word in dict has same length?

step
1.{hit:[hot],hot:[dot,lot],dot:[hot,dog],dog:[dot,log],lot:[hot,dot,log],cog[dog,log]}
hit:[ait,bit,cit]
